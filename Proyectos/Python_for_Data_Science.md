1.  The minimum passing mark for the **course** is 70%

    - 50% - All Review Questions 

    - 50% - The Final Exam

2.  Though Review Questions and the Final Exam have a passing mark of
    50% respectively, the only grade that matters is the overall grade
    for the **course**.

3.  Review Questions have no time limit. You are encouraged to review
    the course material to find the answers.  Please remember that the
    Review Questions are worth 50% of your final mark.

4.  The final exam has a 1 hour time limit.

5.  Attempts are per **question** in both, the Review Questions and the
    Final Exam:

    - One attempt - For True/False questions

    - Two attempts - For any question other than True/False

6.  There are no penalties for incorrect attempts.

7.  Clicking the \"**Final Check**" button when it
    appears, means your submission is **FINAL**.  You
    will **NOT** be able to resubmit your answer for that
    question ever again.
